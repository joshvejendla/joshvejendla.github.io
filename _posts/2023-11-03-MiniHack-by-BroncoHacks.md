# What Is MiniHack?

MiniHack 2023 is a 5-hour hackathon by BroncoHacks, geared towards beginner to intermediate programmers. It took place on November 3rd, 2023 at Cal Poly Pomona. The challenge for the event was to build a chatbot using OpenAI's API. Towards the end of the workshop, students committed their projects to GitHub and built free, low-code blogs with GitHub Pages.

The challenge had 3 difficulty levels:

* Beginner - 
* Intermediate - 
* Advanced - 

BroncoHacks is a cross-club collaboration between different student organizations at Cal Poly Pomona aiming to build hackathon events at CPP a reality.

The event was a collaboration between the Computer Science Society (CSS), Forensics And Security Technology (FAST), CPP's Google Developer Student Club (GDSC), sheCodes, CPP's GameDev, ./script, and Management Information Systems Student Association (MISSA).

# How I was involved

Towards the end of the workshop, I helped students build their own blogs and portfolios using GitHub Pages. I also worked as a coach for students who needed help with technical issues.
